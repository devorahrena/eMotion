Feel free to try out our app! From the project directory, run
```
    npm install
```
You may need to run
```
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
instead. Then, run
```
    npx expo start
```
to launch. From there, you can scan the QR code with your iPhone camera app or with the Expo Go app on Android. You can also follow the terminal instructions to run it in Simulator.
